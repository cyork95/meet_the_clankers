# Meet the Clankers - Content Strategy Guide

## Recommended Video Lengths by Format

### 📰 **Meet the Clankers (Podcast)**
**Optimal Length: 8-12 minutes**

**Why:**
- YouTube's "sweet spot" for retention is 8-15 minutes
- Allows for 2-3 mid-roll ads (monetization)
- Long enough for depth, short enough to maintain attention
- Fits commute/coffee break consumption

**Structure:**
- Intro: 30 seconds
- 3-4 news stories: 2-3 minutes each
- Outro/CTA: 30 seconds

**Frequency:** Daily (Mon-Fri) or 3x/week

---

### 👻 **Clanker's Night Shift (Horror)**
**Optimal Length: 5-7 minutes**

**Why:**
- Horror works best when concise and atmospheric
- Maintains tension without overstaying welcome
- Easier to produce high-quality visuals/audio
- Perfect for "one story, one sitting"

**Structure:**
- Cold open: 15 seconds (atmospheric)
- Story: 4-5 minutes
- Grimm's sign-off: 30 seconds

**Frequency:** Weekly (every Friday 8 PM)

---

### 🎬 **YouTube Shorts (Both Shows)**
**Length: 30-60 seconds**

**Why:**
- Massive discovery potential
- Repurpose existing content
- Drive traffic to long-form videos

**Ideas:**
1. **Podcast Shorts:**
   - "Hot take of the day" (Quill's best sarcastic line)
   - "Tech fact" (Zeta explains one thing)
   - News headline + 30-second discussion

2. **Horror Shorts:**
   - "2-sentence horror" by Grimm
   - Creepy tech facts
   - Teaser for Friday's full episode

**Frequency:** 2-3x/week (repurposed from main content)

---

## Content Mix Strategy

### Week 1 Example:
- **Monday**: Podcast (10 min)
- **Wednesday**: Podcast (10 min) + Short
- **Friday**: Podcast (10 min) + Horror (6 min) + Short
- **Sunday**: Short (horror teaser)

### Monthly Goals:
- 12-15 podcast episodes
- 4 horror episodes
- 8-12 shorts

---

## YouTube Algorithm Considerations

### ✅ **What Works:**
1. **Consistency** > Quantity
   - Better to post 3x/week reliably than daily inconsistently
2. **Watch Time** > Views
   - 6-minute video with 80% retention beats 15-minute with 40%
3. **CTR (Click-Through Rate)**
   - Thumbnails and titles are CRITICAL
4. **Shorts → Long-Form Pipeline**
   - Use shorts to drive subscribers to main content

### ⚠️ **Avoid:**
- Videos under 3 minutes (unless shorts)
- Videos over 20 minutes (unless exceptional content)
- Inconsistent upload schedule

## Recommendations for Your Channel

### Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Establish Rhythm
- **Podcast**: 3x/week, 8-10 minutes
- **Horror**: 1x/week, 5-6 minutes
- **Shorts**: 2x/week

### Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Scale Up
- **Podcast**: Daily, 10-12 minutes
- **Horror**: 1x/week, 6-8 minutes

### Phase 3 (Months 7+): Optimize
- Analyze retention data
- Double down on what works
- Consider special formats (debates, deep dives, etc.)

## Implementation

I can update the generators to support:
1. **Target duration parameter** (e.g., `--duration short/medium/long`)
2. **Shorts mode** (30-60 second clips)
3. **Automatic subtitle generation** (already done!)

Want me to implement these features?
